Flowli is not a simple CMS platform, besides being used to publish new content in your website and engage with your audience, it also allows for complex tracking, content analysis and subscription based content monetization.

I was part of the development team that rebuilt it from a monolithic app to an all new modular and component based architecture using Backobone.js with Marionette.js and Typescript.
