Worked with a team of developers to create a single page app using Angular 2. This app was created to replace an MS ACCESS process.
<br/><br/>
It enables staff members of a company to create Events and then invite users based on their preferences. The app communicates with an ASP.NET Core web API that uses a MongoDB database.
It also uses Amazon API to send SMS to its users.
