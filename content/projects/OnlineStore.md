Configured an online store based on WordPress and developed PHP scripts to integrate it with a BackOffice developed from scratch in Angular 2.
<br/><br/>
This app communicates with an ASP.NET web API to process the payments and store the orders in an MSSQL database.
<br/><br/>
Implemented a payment processor using Unicre and SIBS APIs (Portuguese payment companies) and developed a solution to integrate orders data into the clientâ€™s BackOffice.
