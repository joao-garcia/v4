- Refactored a legacy CMS application into a modular architecture,
  composed by a .NET Core WebAPI, a Core backend (implemented
  using a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, with dependency
  injection via AutoFac and a MongoDB Repository) and a web app
  using BackboneJS, MarionetteJS, React and TypeScript.
- Created a client website that uses the above CMS, implemented with
  a distributed data cache system. Used Razor views, custom tag
  helpers, view components and TypeScript.
