Worked in the development of an ERP for the Oil and Gas industry, an auxiliary tool in the management of different types of assets, people and other resources.

I was part of the development team that created an API using .NET Core connected to a PostgreSQL database via entity framework.

I was also part of the fronted development, which was was built using Angular 2-7 combined with Redux(NgRX).

The project is a success and is currently implemented in some major companies.
