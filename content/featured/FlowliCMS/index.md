Flowli is a CMS platform, besides being used to publish new content in a website and engage with an audience, it also allows for complex tracking, content analysis and subscription based content monetization.

I was part of the development team that rebuilt it from a monolithic app to an all new modular and component based architecture using Backobone.js with Marionette.js, Typescript and most recently React.js
