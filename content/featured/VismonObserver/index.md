I was the tech leader responsible for the implementation of an ETL pipeline that extracted, transformed and aggregated mobile network raw data, so it could be in a more meaningful format for visual representation.
<br/><br/>
The pipeline was implemented using the pipes & filters pattern in a micro services architecture, the technologies used to achieve this were RabbitMQ, .NET Framework and MongoDB.
<br/><br/>
Elastic Search and Kibana were used to monitor the whole system, using custom made dashboards in Kibana.
